### 🎯 Welcome to the Data Structure Dojo - Where Code Meets Craft

Ever felt like your data structures knowledge needs a black belt upgrade? You're in the right dojo! This repository is a
hands-on training ground for mastering the art of data structures in Java.

#### What's Inside:

- 📚 Implementations of classic data structures with a modern twist
- 🎯 Comprehensive test cases using JUnit to ensure your structures are unbreakable
- 📝 Detailed documentation that doesn't read like a boring textbook
- ⚡ Performance analysis because speed matters (and I'm a bit obsessed)

#### Featured Implementations:

- Arrays that pack a punch
- Linked Lists that never break their chain
- Trees that grow stronger by the day
- Graphs that connect the dots
- Heaps that stay in shape
- Hash tables that never hash and run

#### Built with:

- Java (because we're classy like that)
- JUnit (for testing our structural integrity)
- Maven (keeping our dependencies in check)

Join the dojo, and let's turn your data structure skills from white belt to black belt! 🥋
